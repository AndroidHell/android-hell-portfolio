But for real, have you ever had chocolate for breakfast? Or ice cream? Does it really seem so crazy when you think about what cereal actually is?

Hello recruiter, or employer, or other. It’s anarchy, isn’t it? It’s anarchy all the way down. You spend weeks combing over a pile of resumes, trying to find a perfect candidate just based off of words on a printed piece of paper. And then you need to call 8 different people to try and arrange interviews that fit for both parties’ schedules. And eventually you have to decide on who to pick based on seemingly arbitrary sets of rules, by HR, and managers, and the janitor, Juan, who does a banging job cleaning the toilets. Seriously, give that man a raise. Why is Juan allowed to make rules anyway? Rules? Wasn’t this whole anarchy thing your idea?

But you finally find the perfect human to fill the role in question and it either works or it doesn’t. If it works you guys get to go back to planning your monthly potluck to boost morale, and if it doesn’t, you have to do the whole charade over again. I get it.

But like, also, those of us applying to 600 jobs a month, we struggle too. I’m no good at interviews and my skillset, let’s be honest, is a hot mess. I’ve worn many hats over the years. And at 40 years old, just now decided what I want to do when I grow up. Momma, when I grow up, I wanna make the bestest websites for everyone!

I donno. Maybe this should be more formal? But why would I want to do that when I am wanting to show you, the recruiter or employer what I really am? I have the worst time trying to follow the rules of formality and my default if goofy. Like “gorsh!” level goofy. It’s just who I am.

But also, I really do just want to make websites. If you are reading is, you are more than likely trying to fill a web dev position(f you are form the IT side, I do that too). But I guess I just want to have something up here that shows me in a sincere way, a way that doesn’t ever come out in interviews because I am so focused on not dying from anxiety and trying to make sure I do all the social queue stuff. Shake hands, nod, smile, etc.

So, I guess I just want this posted to make it a bit easier on you. If you took the time to read this, this is essentially how I am. Let it be a guidepost for your consideration. This is probably way more functional than yet another assessment test and automated screening questionnaire.

Speaking of…

I know when I need to ask a higher up for assistance. I always treat others like they are humans. Always. I have no other mode. Humans deserve to be treated no less. I can manage my time but sometimes get overwhelmed with projects deadlines and need to readjust occasionally. I am a human. I have anxiety. Sometimes when a customer is mean to me, I take it personally but not really personally. I’ve had conflicts with coworkers and never had to resort to a pistol duel to resolve the conflict. I can probably add more later but you get it. I’m just another amalgamation of parts that make me up. Sometimes I need to take a break and recharge, other times I need someone to tell me to takes a break. I want to make things that people actually want, with no shortcuts, and no extra stuff slapped on top.

If you made it this far, consider me if you are after a dedicated, loyal worker that just wanted to build websites that make people happy. I can do that. Basically, with me, you get what is on the label. Web developer with depression, anxiety, autism, and too much coffee, that just wants to make the internet look better and actually functional.
